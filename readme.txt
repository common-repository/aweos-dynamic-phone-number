== Description ==
AWEOS Dynamic Phone Number lets you type two different phone numbers that will be embedded into your page or post by a Shortcode. The plugin knows automatically with number to put on your site by checking for the glcid or a custom parameter. 

Use our settings page to define the two phone numbers and the parameter we will search for. You can also choose to look for multiple parameters by separating them with commas like: glcid, custom_id, third_id
